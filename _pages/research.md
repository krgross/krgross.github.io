These days, I study the "science of science", that is, how the norms and institutions of science impact how scientists learn about the world.  I was trained, however, as an ecological theorist, and I maintain an interest in ecological theory especially as it pertains to population dynamics.  

# Science of science  
Contemporary science can be viewed as a complex dynamical system, with many participants embedded in an increasingly connected social network and each acting according to their own worldviews and incentives.  How does such a community of scholars allocate scarce resources to acquire knowledge reliably and efficiently?  I am interested in using mathematical models to understand this question and others in the burgeoning field of the science of science.  I collaborate closely with [Carl Bergstrom](http://ctbergstrom.com/){:target="\_blank"} in this work.  So far, we have explored how publication bias facilitates or impedes the collective evaluation of scientific claims of modest import, used the economics of contests to investigate how funding agencies can promote scientific discovery most efficiently, and have argued that proposal-based and outcome-based peer review create conflicting incentives for researchers.

## The dynamics of structured populations.  
For most macroscopic organisms, individuals within a population differ in many significant ways.  "Structured" population dynamics refers to characterizing the population not just by the number of individuals in it, but also by the distribution of one or more of these key demographic characteristics across individuals within the population.  Age, size, and gender are all classic variables by which populations are often structured.  I am interested in the mathematics of describing the dynamics of these populations, and in statistical methods to reconcile these models with observed data.  I have returned to the study of structured populations at various points through my career.  Most recently, I have worked with collaborators Peter Edmunds, Bob Carpenter, and Andre de Roos to study the size-structured dynamics of reef-forming corals.  We used these models to study how chronic environmental change (such as ocean acidification) and acute disturbances (such as coral bleaching events) have the potential to reshape coral populations and the ecosystems they support.  In previous work, Peter and I used vector autoregressive models (statistical models for time-series data) to estimate metrics of ecosystem stability for coral communities in St. John, USVI. 

## Environmental geometry and species diversity.   
One of the most celebrated challenges in ecology is to explain the fascinating prevalence of large-scale patterns in biological diversity.  Most attention has been paid to why there are more species in the tropics, but similar questions can be asked of elevational gradients along mountainsides, depth transects in the ocean, or even microbial gradients within the human body.  Many hypotheses have been proposed to explain these biodiversity gradients, and arbitrating among these hypotheses requires an accurate understanding of the predictions that each makes.  Towards this end, former MS student Andrew Snyder-Beattie and I constructed a mathematical model that synthesizes a subset of these hypotheses that fundamentally rely on the geometry of environmental variation, such as latitudinal or elevational temperature gradients.  Surprisingly, our model shows that together these geometric hypotheses predict more subtle and nuanced fine structure in biodiversity gradients than any single geometric hypothesis does alone.  Encouragingly, these predictions seem to match fine structure that has been noted in multiple published empirical gradients, although that fine structure has rarely received deep attention (perhaps because of a lack of theory that anticipates it).  A first paper describing our model appeared in The American Naturalist.

##  Transgenic pest control.   
Genetic technologies offer new promises for regulating abundances of unwanted pest species.  Mathematical modeling will be a key component of the design of successful pest-control strategies using transgenic methods.  The Genetic Engineering and Society Center at NCSU, in which I participate, brings together scholars to examine the social, biological, and technical aspects of the use of genetic technology for various objectives, including the management of unwanted pests.  Former PhD student Gregory Backus has developed the first mathematical models for exploring how transgenic technology might be used to eradicate invasive species from island ecosystems in ways that are more environmentally benign than other contemporary alternatives.
