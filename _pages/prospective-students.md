There are several different routes to graduate degrees at NCSU.  Students interested in working with me can study in [Biology](https://biologygraduateprogram.wordpress.ncsu.edu/){:target="\_blank"}, [Biomathematics](http://bma.math.ncsu.edu/){:target="\_blank"}, or [Statistics](https://statistics.sciences.ncsu.edu/graduate/){:target="\_blank"}, or combinations thereof.  Please read my [letter to prospective students](/files/letter_to_prospective_students.pdf){:target="\_blank"} for more information, and then contact me if you would like to discuss possibilities.
