## Current

* **Andrew Freedman** (jointly with George Kennedy), BMA / Entomology PhD student.  Andrew is interested in using a behavioral perspective to understand the spread of insect-vectored plant pathogens.

## Alumni

### Post-docs

* [**Erin Mordecai**](https://www.mordecailab.com/){:target="\_blank"} (jointly with Charles Mitchell, UNC). Erin studied how global environmental change impacts the diversity of pathogens transmitted by insect vectors. 

* [**Christopher Stone**](https://directory.illinois.edu/detail?userId=cstone@illinois.edu&widgetId=42){:target="\_blank"}.  Chris studied the plastic and adaptive responses of insect disease-vectors to management interventions.

### Graduate students

* [**Gregory Backus**](https://gregbackus.weebly.com/){:target="\_blank"} (jointly with Nick Haddad), Biomathematcs / Zoology PhD.  Greg studied how genetic technologies can reduce the impact of invasive species on native ecosystems. 

* [**Judith Canner**](https://judith-canner.netlify.app/){:target="\_blank"} (jointly with Rob Dunn), Biomathematcs / Zoology PhD.  Judith studied the population ecology of ant-dispersed plants. 

* **Ian Fiske**, Statistics PhD.  Ian studied the use of latent-variable models to analyze wildlife survey data with imperfect detection and ordinal responses.   

* **Matt Hamilton**, Biomathematcs MS.  Matt studied the effect of dispersal on coexistence in a metacommunity model.

* **Tessa Hall**, Biomathematcs MS.  Tessa modeled the effects of ocean acidification on the population dynamics of reef-forming corals.

* **Becky Lyzinski**, Biomathematcs MS.  Becky constructed mathematical models to analyze the dynamics of multiple interacting pathogens.

* **Amanda Reeder**, Masters of Biomathematics.  Amanda developed improved statistical models for blue crab abundance in Pamlico Sound.

* [**Andrew Snyder-Beattie**](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/about/team/andrew-snyder-beattie){:target="\_blank"}, Biomathematcs MS.  Andrew developed a new mathematical model for predicting latitudinal gradients in species diversity.

* **Yabo Wu**, Masters of Biomathematics.  Yabo studied the use of autoregressive models to approximate one- and two-species models of stochastic population dynamics.
