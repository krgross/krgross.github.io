Thank you for visiting this webpage.  I am a professor in the [Department of Statistics](https://statistics.sciences.ncsu.edu/) at [North Carolina State University](https://www.ncsu.edu/). I am also affilated with NCSU's [Biomathematics Graduate Program](http://bma.math.ncsu.edu) and [Department of Applied Ecology](https://cals.ncsu.edu/applied-ecology/). 

My main research area is the social organization of science, or what some call the "science of science".  I began my career working in ecological population dynamics.
